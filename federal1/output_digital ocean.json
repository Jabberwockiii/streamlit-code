MONITORING OCEAN ACIDIFICATION, WHICH RESULTS FROM THE ACCUMULATION OF CO2, IS OF CRITICAL INTEREST, SINCE PROGRESSIVE ACIDIFICATION IS ALREADY AFFECTING OCEANS AND COASTAL ESTUARIES AND WATERWAYS. TO THAT END, NASA AND NOAA ARE SEEKING IN-SITU MONITORING DEVICES FOR OCEANIC AND COASTAL WATER MONITORING, INCLUDING A PH SENSOR FOR SEAWATER, TO SUPPORT SPACE-BASED MONITORING PROGRAMS. MONITORING OCEAN PH ACCURATELY OVER LARGE AREAS HAS PROVED TO BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, AND CLASSIC SENSOR TECHNOLOGY, BASED ON POTENTIOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS (PH ELECTRODES), HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS: CURRENT INSTRUMENTS ARE EXPENSIVE, DO NOT MONITOR PH DIRECTLY, AND THEREFORE NEED COMPLEX SIGNAL COMPENSATION TO YIELD ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS, AND REQUIRE FREQUENT CALIBRATION. INTELLIGENT OPTICAL SYSTEMS PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A NOVEL LUMINESCENT SENSOR FOR PH, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NOVEL MATERIALS DEVELOPED TO MONITOR PH AND OTHER PARAMETERS OF INTEREST IN HIGH SALINITY AND ELEVATED PRESSURE ENVIRONMENTS; IT WILL EXHIBIT HIGH SELECTIVITY (DIRECT PH MEASUREMENTS) AND STABILITY. A NOVEL ANTIFOULING TECHNOLOGY WITH NO MECHANICAL PARTS WILL PREVENT SENSOR DEGRADATION IN SEAWATER. TO CONTAIN THE COST OF THE ELECTRONICS WHILE MAINTAINING HIGH PERFORMANCE IN DETECTING THE LUMINESCENT SIGNAL, WE WILL USE CIRCUIT SEED CIRCUITS, WHICH PROCESS ANALOG SIGNALS ON 100% DIGITAL COMPONENTS. THIS ENABLES THEM TO REDUCE SIZE AND PARTS COUNT, SIMPLIFYING QUALITY CONTROL AND POWER REQUIREMENTS, AND WILL ENABLE US TO PRODUCE HIGH-PERFORMANCE, LOW-COST OPTOELECTRONIC UNITS.",

THE ANTIGLARE LED DISPLAY WITH DIRECTVUE TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS FOR SUNLIGHT READABILITY. THE NOTEBOOK IS CAPABLE OF RUNNING THE HYPACK LITE SOFTWARE AND NOBELTEC SOFTWARE PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED. HYPACK LITE IS USED TO RECORD BATHYMETRY DATA COLLECTED FROM ONBOARD FATHOMETERS AND ALSO INTERFACES WITH NOBELTEC SOFTWARE ALLOWING THE SCIENTIST TO MARK SAMPLING LOCATIONS REAL-TIME IN THE FIELD ALONG WITH OTHER PERTINENT DATA AND INFORMATION WHICH IS THEN STORED IN AN ELECTRONIC LOG.THE DELL FIELD NOTEBOOK IN ADDITION TO A US B PORT  WILL NEED TO BE EQUIPPED WITH A SERIAL PORT AND PCMCIA SLOT BECAUSE A LOT OF OLDER FIELD EQUIPMENT DOES NOT ADAPT WELL TO USB PORTS OR ADAPTERS, THE PCMICIA SLOT ALLOWS FOR THE ADDITION OF ADDITIONAL SERIAL PORTS IF NEEDED TO CONNECT TO MULTIIPLE COMPUTERS. A DVD WRITER IS NEEDED FOR BACKING UP DATA ON DVDS. A CARRYING CASE IS NEEDED TO TRANSPORT THE FIELD NOTEBOOK SAFELY.  EPA R6 HAS 14 ACTIVE ODMDS AND 5 NEW SITES ARE BEING ADDED. FEDERAL REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT EPA MONITORS ITS SITES.  WE HAVE A LONG RANGE PLAN TO VISIT ALL OF THE SITES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS TO COLLECT BATHYMETRY, SIDE SCAN SONAR DATA, SEDIMENT SAMPLES, AND SEDIMENT PROFILE SAMPLES. THE DELL FIELD NOTEBOOK ALONG WITH THE HYPACK LITE SOFTWARE AND NOBELTEC SOFTWARE WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN THE ACQUISITION OF DATA FOR THESE SAMPLING TECHNIQUES. WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE PURCHASE OF THE DELL LATITUDE E6420 XFR FIELD NOTEBOOK BECAUSE IT MEETS OUR FIELD COMPUTING NEEDS FOR FY 13 AND INTO THE FUTURE.",
