        "Description": "IGF::OT::IGF  WE PROPOSE A NOVEL TECHNOLOGY TO LEVERAGE RAPIDLY EVOLVING CLOUD BASED INFRASTRUCTURE TO IMPROVE TIME CONSTRAINED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS FOR REAL-TIME DECISION MAKING. OUR \"CLOUDTURBINE\" INNOVATION ELIMINATES THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN FILES AND STREAMS. STREAMING AND STATIC DATA HAVE LONG BEEN CONSIDERED SEPARATELY. WHEREAS STREAMING DATA PROTOCOLS CONTINUE TO FRAGMENT, A GREAT UNIFICATION OF APPROACH FOR STATIC DATA HAS OCCURRED. THE PARADIGM FOR FILE-SHARING SERVICES IS SIMPLE: (1) PUT DATA IN A LOCAL FILE FOLDER, (2) IT AUTOMATICALLY SHOWS UP AT OTHER LINKED SYSTEMS. WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF ONE COULD UNIFY AN APPROACH FOR STREAMING DATA WHILE LEVERAGING THE FILE-SHARING CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE? THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT WE PROPOSE. CLOUDTURBINE IS A STREAMING DATA INTERFACE TO FILE-SHARING AND FILE-TRANSPORT SERVICES SUCH AS DROPBOX AND FTP. IT DELEGATES MUCH OF THE DATA TRANSMITTAL, SECURITY, AND SERVER RESOURCES TO THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE. IT ELIMINATES THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN FILES AND STREAMS, AND ENABLES A SIMPLE, COST EFFECTIVE NEW PARADIGM FOR STREAMING DATA MIDDLEWARE. PHASE I DEMONSTRATED THE FEATURES, UTILITY, AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROTOTYPE CLOUDTURBINE TO BE VERY APPROPRIATE FOR A WIDE RANGE OF DATA-STREAMING APPLICATIONS. A SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE ISSUE IS THE INHERENT LATENCY IMPOSED BY FILE BUNDLING PLUS TRANSFER TIME. TESTING HAS PROVEN THIS TO BE TRACTABLE, WITH LOW LATENCY (2-5S) FOR SEVERAL FILE SHARING SERVICES, AND VERY LOW LATENCY (10-50MS) FOR PROTOCOLS SUCH AS FTP AND MAPPED DRIVES. WE PROPOSE AN OPEN SOURCE CLOUDTURBINE WEB PORTAL AS A HUB TO PROVIDE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO NASA, SCIENTIFIC, AND INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITIES. FOLLOWING THE LEGACY OF THE EARLIER-GENERATION DATATURBINE, WE WILL VIGOROUSLY MOVE TO ESTABLISH A SELF-SUSTAINING OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY WHICH PROVIDES CLOUDTURBINE ACCESS, DEVELOPMENT, SERVICES, SPIN-OFF PRODUCTS, AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT.",
